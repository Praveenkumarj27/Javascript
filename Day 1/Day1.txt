Difference between react and angular?
     React is a library, but Angular is a full-fledged framework. 
The virtual DOM and one-way data binding are used by React.js,but the real DOM and two-way data binding 
are used by Angular. There's also a speed difference (React's is faster) and a difference in bundle size 
(React's is smaller).

Difference between npm and npx?
       NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is installed  when NodeJS is installed and  
comes with a command-line interface (CLI), used to interact with the NPM database, that hosts public
and private packages.
       NPX stands for Node Package eXecute and like NPM, it is installed when we get NodeJS. 
It is basically a NPM package runner,which allows us to run JavaScript packages without installing it.That means 
that if you only need to use something just once NPX is perfect,and package pollution is not a concern.



While loop and do while loop
    The do...while statements combo defines a code block to be executed once, and repeated as long as a 
condition is true.
    The do...while is used when you want to run a code block at least one time.
